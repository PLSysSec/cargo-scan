## Analysis

h2 is an HTTP2 protocol implementation.
This crate relies on `http` and `tokio` for network access,
so while it doesn't use any import patterns that we searched for,
it indirectly has a lot of complexity and side effects.

The actual imports flagged above are only in a test module, hence not actually
shipped with the crate.
I'm not familiar enough to know whether a typical use of the crate would
involve a fixed finite list of network address accesses, or a possibly
large list, and whether or not this list would be known statically.

## Security summary

1. Security risks

Network access

2. Permissions

Network access, and whatever permissions are needed by tokio/http.

3. Transitive risk

Yes, likely

4. Feasibility of automated analysis

- Spec: project-dependent
- Static analysis: potentially difficult
- Dynamic enforcement overhead: possibly high
