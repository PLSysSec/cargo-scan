# 2022-09-28 Audit

I audited the 5 crates (out of the top 200) that have exactly 1 dangerous import. They are:

1. stable_deref_trait imports std::path::PathBuf  purely to implement a trait for it (this is completely safe: any other code would have to import PathBuf itself before using it)

2. crossbeam-channel imports std::process purely for two calls to std::process::abort().  I’m not sure why the implementation needs to call abort rather than panic? On the other hand, this seems probably generally safe, but do I want to import code that might bypass my objects’ destructors?

3. termcolor imports std::env to get and set environment variables: env::var_os and env::var. It specifically only cares about two environment variables, TERM and TERM_OS. If importing the crate in this case we can summarize its expected behavior with a finite list of environment variables it wants to access.

4. env_logger also uses std::env::var, but in a less obviously safe manner: it contains a method which calls env::var on a program variable. It’s less clear just looking at the code whether it accesses some limited finite set of environment variables or whether it can read arbitrary env variables.

5. Finally, rustc_version uses std::process::Command, which is in general very heavyweight/dangerous, but in this case it’s (presumably, I didn’t check) only using the command to do something which figures out the rust version, and can’t have any other side effects. So this is a good example of a crate that should be a roughly safe to abstract as having no important side effects, despite having a dangerous implementation.
