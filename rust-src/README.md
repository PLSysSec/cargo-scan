# Cargo Scan

`cargo scan` is an under-development experimental tool to scan and analyze Cargo (Rust) dependencies for security and auditing purposes.
It can also be used in tandem with [cargo vet](https://mozilla.github.io/cargo-vet/).

The tool is currently implemented as a top-level Python wrapper (`scan.py`). Please see [here](https://github.com/PLSysSec/cargo-scan) for usage and installation instructions.
